Blender - UE4 - FGA Vector Field Editor
=======================================

Allows creation and manipulation of vector fields using Blender particle simulations and vector math operations, as well as import/export of the FGA file format used in Unreal Engine 4. 
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
**New Documentation is available here**: https://github.com/isathar/Blender_UE4_VectorFieldEditor/wiki (or the wiki link on the side) 
- Still wip, but almost finished. 
  
Example .blend file with a few different vector fields available here: http://www.mediafire.com/download/6t00h4g25ikxq5i/VF_Examples.blend  
  
Archive with some .fga files exported from the above: http://www.mediafire.com/download/4x174fgf8lmec6g/VF_Examples.zip  
  
  
*New feature: Volume Physics presets*
- Allows quick changing of the physics properties of the particle system attached to a vector field volume
  - Just a few test presets for now. More will be added in the near future.  
    - to enable a preset on your volume, select the volume and go to the bottom of the *Create* panel to select a new preset from the dropdown menu.
    - saving and deleting presets is possible with the + and - buttons on this dropdown menu.

## Features  
 
**Vector Field Editor:**
- Saves current particle system velocities and blends them with saved results using one of the following methods:
  - *Replace, Average, Add, Multiply*
- Particle velocities used in these calculations can be obtained using the following methods:
  - *Velocity, Offset Distance, Angular Velocity, Custom Vector, Point*
- Curve Force tool that uses wind forces to move particles along a line. 
  
**Importer + Exporter** for FGA files for use in Unreal Engine 4

## Installation  
 
- Extract to your addons directory
- Enable it in the addon manager (named *FGA Vector Field Tools*)
- A new section called *Vector Fields* should be available in the tools panel 
- To use the Physics presets, copy the contents of the *presets* folder to Blender's presets folder (.../Blender/2.xx/scripts/presets)

## Notes  
 
###### Performance  
- Blender may stop responding during the Create and Calculate operations, but shouldn't crash.
- On vector fields with a density of less than 128^3, operations should take less than a minute, with lower density fields (<64^3) taking a few seconds at most.
- At maximum density (128^3), creating a new vector field takes about 20 seconds on my mid-range Core i5 based PC, and calculating velocities can take up to 2 minutes (after recent tweaks).
- Performance while editing reasonably sized (< 1 million vertices) vector fields is good, while a 128^3 volume can be painfully slow under the right circumstances.
- Display of velocity lines on large fields (>64^3) is very slow. 
 
###### 128x128x128 and System Memory  
- Editing a 128x128x128 vector field requires a 64-bit system and Blender install, as well as a large amount (> 6-8 GB) of system memory.
- This is due to the amount of particles that need to have their dynamics cached
- To avoid running out of memory while editing very high resolution vector fields, you may want to lower your undo history steps.
- Using a disk cache for your particles may help, too. 
 
###### Console Warning Messages  
- While creating new vector fields, the following messages will appear in your console window:
- `CustomData_copy_data_layer: warning null data for CDOrco type (...)`
- `CustomData_copy_data_layer: warning null data for CDMVert type (...)`
- It looks like these appear because there is no face data in the vector field and can probably be ignored.

    - performance tweaks for creating new vector fields + calculating velocities
    - removed slice selection tool (redundant, easily done in edit mode)
    - matched default scaling to (grid units x field density)
      - distances were at half scale before
      - density variable used for creation is now distance between particles
    - added undo functionality to *Generate* function
    - new velocity mode: Point
